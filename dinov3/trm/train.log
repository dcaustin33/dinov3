/home/derek_austin/dinov3/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pydantic/_internal/_generate_schema.py:2249: UnsupportedFieldAttributeWarning: The 'repr' attribute with value False was provided to the `Field()` function, which has no effect in the context it was used. 'repr' is field-specific metadata, and can only be attached to a model field using `Annotated` metadata or by assignment. This may have happened because an `Annotated` type alias using the `type` statement was used, or if the `Field()` function was attached to a single member of a union type.
